# Sending-Emails
Simple sending email program written in python

## How to use the program
- You need to have a Receiver.txt file and a Message.txt file with the program in the same directory on your local device.
- In the Receiver.txt file:
   - type in: "name, email" in each row
   - You can make a list of people in the Receiver.txt for the people that you want to send to
- In the Message.txt you can write your message.
   - For every message, it will update the "hi" statement depending on the Receiver

## Future updates
Might consider doing a youtube tutorial on this project, explaining how to make it from scratch and how to use it.
